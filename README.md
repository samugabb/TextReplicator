This simple application is made for when you have to copy and paste a long string, but the receiving part does not accept pasting.
For example, if you have to input a very complex password into a remote machine and Clipboard Sharing is not enabled for security reasons.

# How to use TextReplicator

- Start TextReplicator
- Copy the text you want to paste
- Press the "Copy from clipboard and GO" button
- Focus the window/program in which you want to paste the text
- The program will wait three seconds, and then write the text back as keyboard input

# Options

There are just a couple options:
- You can change the time which passes from when you press the button until the text gets written back, by using the builtin slider
- You can also choose to view the TextBox contents by pressing the "eye" icon on the left

# Extra

- If you want to keep the program open, just minimize it and it will hide in the system tray, as a Notify Icon. Double click the Icon to open the form again.
  You can also open the form (or close the program) by right-clicking the icon in the system tray and using the menu
- If you want to manually paste the text from your clipboard onto the application, just paste it into the textbox and press "GO"
- You can disable the function that sends the ENTER key at the end of the text, by disabling the "press ENTER afterwards" checkbox
